# True Modules workspace (scaffold)

This repository was bootstrapped with `tm init`. Start by reviewing `compose.json` and the scaffold module under `modules/demo.hello/`.

Next steps:

1. Install dev dependencies (`npm install` or `pnpm install`) and add lint/typecheck tooling as you grow the workspace.
2. Run `node tm.mjs doctor --json --artifacts artifacts` to confirm your environment has Node, Rust, ESLint, and TypeScript configured and capture `artifacts/doctor.json` for your records.
3. Iterate on modules under `modules/`, capturing specs in `spec/` and reference material in `docs/`.

See [`docs/links.md`](./docs/links.md) for additional guides.
