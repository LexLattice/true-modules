  "prompt": "Follow-up — Harden Harvest + Selection\r\n\r\nObjective: tighten BO4 harvest validation and persist the meta winner so compose/gates target the intended variant.\r\nKey files: scripts/bo4-harvest.mjs, scripts/bo4-meta-run.mjs, scripts/bo4-compose.mjs, runs/<slug>/run.json.\r\nImplementation steps\r\n\r\nHarvest guardrail – in bo4-harvest.mjs, inspect each harvested variant’s modules/ tree recursively and require at least one module.json. If none are found (or modules/ is missing), exit with tmError('E_VARIANT_NO_MODULES', …) before writing manifest entries. Record the harvested module ids/count in the manifest for later stages.\r\nWinner recording – when bo4-meta-run.mjs finishes, determine the chosen variant (either from --variant or the meta scorer’s default) and persist it under run.json.selection (variant number + rationale). Continue to store compose_sha256 at the manifest root.\r\nCompose alignment – update bo4-compose.mjs to require run.json.selection.variant and load the corresponding harvested variant. Remove the “first variant” fallback so compose/gates fail fast if no selection exists. Keep the existing context resequencing for events.\r\nAcceptance\r\n\r\nA harvested variant without a module.json now exits immediately with E_VARIANT_NO_MODULES.\r\nSuccessful meta runs populate run.json.selection.variant alongside compose_sha256.\r\nbo4-compose.mjs refuses to run when selection.variant is absent or mismatched; when present, it uses that variant’s harvested modules and still produces the merged event stream.",
